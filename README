Loggi is a simple logging bot for a small IRC server, written to keep channel history
on my home ngIRCd.

The bot is controlled by sending privmsg with commands to it (/msg <bot-nick> <command>).
The following commands are available:

join <channel>                | join the channel
part <channel>                | part from the channel
log <channel>                 | get logging status - returns 'enabled'/'disabled'
log <channel> set_enabled     | enable logging on channel
log <channel> set_disabled    | disable logging on channel
log <channel> length          | get max number of logged messages for channel, if no such limit - returns empty message
log <channel> length <number> | set max number of logged messages for channel
log <channel> read            | get logged messages in channel
log <channel> read <+-number> | get number of first/last logged messages in channel
log <channel> reset           | clear channel's log

NOTE per-channel logs (accessible through the /msg interface) are sotred in-memory.
NOTE To use 'log' and 'part' commands for a channel, you should be present on that channel

The interface is a bit raw/wordy/inconvenient, but I beleive user can handle it by
defining macroses on his client.

Logs are printed to stdout, so users can make further processing by attaching
to it (or just redirrect to /dev/null)

Example of basic docker-compose.yml (with env variables used):
version: "2.2"

services:
    loggi:
        image: loggi
        build: https://github.com/h-castle/loggi.git
        environment:
            - LOGGI_SERVER=ngircd
            - LOGGI_PORT=6697
            - LOGGI_USER=bot-log
            - LOGGI_NICK=bot-log-nick
            - LOGGI_KEY=MyPasswd1234
            - LOGGI_CHANNELS=name=#chan0,key=pwd,log;name=#chan1,key=pwd,log,len=100
            - LOGGI_TLS=1
            - PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
